Exercise :2
1.) Sam found how many hours of sunshine vs how many ice creams were sold at the shop
from Monday to Friday:

Calculate y = mx + b using formula. Calculate the correlation coefficient between two
variables. Find a linear regression equation line. Also find least squares of errors. Also check
whether least squares is sensitive to outlier by introducing.  Draw box plot that is useful to
detect outliers and give your inference on it.
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import linregress
x = np.array([2,3,5,7,9])
y = np.array([4,5,7,10,15])

m,b, r, p, std_err = linregress(x, y)

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()

print("Linear Regression Equation: y = {:.2f}x + {:.2f}".format(m, b))
print("Correlation Coefficient (r): {:.2f}".format(r))

y_pred = m*x + b
lse = np.sum((y-y_pred) ** 2)

print("Least Squares of Errors (SSE) : {:.2f}".format(lse))

2.)The local ice cream shop keeps track of how much ice cream they sell versus the noon
temperature on that day. Here are their figures for the last 12 days:
Ice Cream Sales vs Temperature


Give line of best fit using scatter plot. use that equation to interpolate a sales value at 21° and
to extrapolate a sales value at 29°
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import linregress
from scipy import interpolate
x = np.matrix('1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1;12,16.4,11.9,15.2,18.5,22.1,19.4,25.1,23.4,18.1,22.6,17.2')
y = np.matrix('215,325,185,332,406,522,412,614,544,421,445,408')
print(x)
print(y)
m=np.dot(x,x.transpose())
n=np.linalg.inv(m)
q=np.dot(x,y.transpose())
b=np.dot(n,q)
print(b)

a=np.matrix('12,16.4,11.9,15.2,18.5,22.1,19.4,25.1,23.4,18.1,22.6,17.2')
c=b[0][0]+a.transpose()*b[1][0]

x1=np.array(a)
y1=np.array(c)
plt.scatter(x1,y1)
plt.show()

x2=np.matrix(‘21,29’)
y2=b[0][0]+x2.transpose()*b[0][1]
x3=np.array(x2)
y3=np.array(y2)
plt.scatter(x3,y3)
plt.show

3.) Suppose that we are statistical consultants hired by a client to provide advice on how to
improve sales of a particular product. The Advertising data set consists of the sales of that
product in 200 different markets, along with advertising budgets for the product in each of
those markets for three different media: TV, radio, and newspaper.
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/advertising-dataset
What is the relationship between sales and TV budget?
Check whether Increasing sales through advertising is having impact or not. Construct
a confidence interval around the slope of a regression line.
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import linregress


data=pd.read_csv('advertising.csv')
print(data.head())


x=data['TV']
y=data['Sales']


slope,intercept,r_value,p_value,std_err=linregress(x,y)
print("y=",slope,"x+",intercept)


stderr_slope=std_err
margin_of_error=2.228*stderr_slope
lower_bound=slope-margin_of_error
upper_bound=slope+margin_of_error
print("95% confidence interval for the slope of linear regression:",lower_bound,",",upper_bound)
